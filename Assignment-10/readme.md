Universal selectors are used to style every element on the page. Element selectors are used to select all element of one type. The Id selector and Class selector both allow users to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique id. Each one has there own advantages and utility. Class selectors are a best way to select elements that serve the same function. Universal is best when a rule needs to apply to all or most elements.

I choose this color palette in an attempt to match the soothing and peacefulness that a good sunset brings to all people. I wanted to use colors directly from the picture, which is why I used them. Not the best palette, but I wanted to have some fun with it.

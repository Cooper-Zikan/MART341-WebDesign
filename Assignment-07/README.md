I have seen several forms on numerous websites. The ones I run into the most often are newsletter sign-ups, online payments, contest registration and customer feedback. Its a medium that allows customers to directly interact with you and the company. This drives up website engagement, which provides a business more profit and helps them find ways to improve. Website engagement is crucial for longevity in the space. Newsletter signups allow consumers to get news of sales, specials or newly stocked merchandise. Online payments are crucial for generating revenue for companies. This became particularly more important during the covid pandemic. Contest registration is often used in the form of giveaways. This helps increase website traffic and has many other uses. Customer feedback is important because companies are looking to improve in any way possible. In the business world, if you are not improving you are worsening.

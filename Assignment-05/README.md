On the wayback machine I looked up amazon.com. The version I looked up was from may of 2006. The biggest difference between the 2006 version and the 2022 edition was the use of images. The old version used way more text, and it was far more cluttered and confusing. The newer version makes scrolling far easier, and the text to click on a link is far easier to use/find. The older version has far more white space and is not very efficient. The 2022 version uses its space far more effectively while still having a clean and uncluttered website.

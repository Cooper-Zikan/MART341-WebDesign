Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.

You should not choose fallback fonts carelessly. There are instances where primary fonts load slowly, and the next font in the stack takes its place while processing occurs. Having two unrelated fonts flash in can be jarring, and negatively impact page layout.

System fonts are those already installed on your local device and system. Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server. They do not have to be available on the user's device to appear, but require certain elements to get called up correctly. Fonts that developers can count on being available by the system are known as "web-safe" fonts.
